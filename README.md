# What is a Spirograph?
The Spirograph is a classic mathematical tool that has been cherished by artists for generations. Its beauty lies in its simplicity: a set of circles interlacing to form intricate designs. The Spirograph Generator brings this timeless technique to life, offering you the chance to experiment with captivating visuals.

# How to use the Spirograph Generator?
Creating Art with the Spirograph Generator is both intuitive and exciting. You control three key parameters, each influencing the final result:
* "k" Factor: Adjust the size of the smaller circle as it revolves around the center. Watch as different values create everything from delicate, lace-like motifs to bold, sweeping designs.
* "l" Factor: Define the distance from the center to the pen, influencing the proportions and intricacy of your artwork. Play with this parameter to craft designs ranging from intricate mandalas to expansive orbits.
* Drawing Time / Final Angle of Turning: Control the duration of the drawing process.
